# IoT Apple Watch Project: COVID-19 Cases Reporter Application in Bangkok, Thailand Using API

  This was a project for my Computer and Technology class in Secondary 4 where I got to choose any IoT items in my house to do any kind of project with, my Apple Watch Series 2 was at close reach so I chose it. I didn't know what to do with my project, but then I decided to make an app.
  
  I had my helper with me, I would be lying if I said that I did all of the coding on my own as I didn't know how to code with Swift, so I started to get to the basics first. The huge problem here is the due date, the project is due at the end of the month and the application is way more complex than the basics I had been learning. So my helper decided to teach me how to code the app straight to the point, I learnt what an API is and other different files we need to use.
